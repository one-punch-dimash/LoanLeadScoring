# Evaluating the Efficacy of Lead Scoring: A Predictive Model for Loan Acquisition

## Overview
This project, led by me, Dinmukhamed Aitkali, focuses on showing how well-structured ML decisions may enhance lead scoring systems in banking industry, with a specific emphasis on predicting loan uptakes. The goal is to analyze initial customer data and actual loan decisions to refine prediction models, thereby improving the accuracy in identifying potential loan customers.

## Introduction
In the fast-paced and competitive world of finance, the ability to accurately predict customer behavior, particularly in the context of loan acquisition, is invaluable. This project aims to revolutionize lead scoring systems by integrating advanced machine learning algorithms, enabling adaptability and enhancing prediction accuracy.

## Research Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To develop a sophisticated predictive model using machine learning techniques.
- To analyze customer behavior patterns that influence loan acceptance decisions.
- To validate and optimize the model across different timeframes for robustness.
- To assess the impact of this model on banking operations, particularly in terms of marketing efficiency and resource allocation.

## Methodology
I am adopting a quantitative approach, utilizing anonymized banking datasets for this research. Key steps in the methodology include:
- Preprocessing and exploratory analysis of the data.
- Selecting and engineering relevant features for the predictive model.
- Training and comparing various statistical and machine learning models.
- Validating the model with out-of-time data to ensure its effectiveness.
- Interpreting the results within the context of banking industry's requirements for lead scoring.
