# Evaluating the Efficacy of Lead Scoring: A Predictive Model for Loan Acquisition

## Overview
This project, led by Dinmukhamed Aitkali, focuses on enhancing lead scoring systems in banking using machine learning, with an emphasis on predicting loan uptakes. The goal is to analyze customer data and actual loan decisions to refine prediction models, thereby improving accuracy in identifying potential loan customers.

**Feature Descriptions:**
1. **AGE:** Age of the client in years.
2. **CHILDREN_CNT:** Count of children the client has.
3. **EDUCATION:** Highest level of education attained by the client.
4. **CLIENT_INCOME_AMT:** Monthly income of the client in Tenge currency.
5. **IS_CAR_FLG:** Flag indicating if the client owns a car (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
6. **ADD_INCOME_AMT:** Additional income amount of the client, if any, in Tenge currency.
7. **CARD_CUR_CNT:** Current count of credit/debit cards held by the client.
8. **REMN_PAYMENT_CNT:** Remaining number of payments the client has on existing loans.
9. **LOAN_DAY_CNT:** Number of days since the client's last loan was issued.
10. **TR_MBANLOG_CNT_Q2:** Count of mobile banking logins by the client in the second quarter.
11. **MAX_CREDIT_REST_HY2:** Maximum remaining credit amount on all client's loans in the first half of the year.
12. **CUR_DEP_AMT:** Current amount deposited in the clientâ€™s accounts.
13. **CUR_CREDIT_AMT:** Current total credit amount the client has with the bank.
14. **Target:** Binary target variable indicating whether the client took up a loan offer (1) or not (0).

All personal data is anonymized to protect client confidentiality.

## Research Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To develop a sophisticated predictive model using machine learning techniques.
- To analyze customer behavior patterns that influence loan acceptance decisions.
- To validate and optimize the model across different timeframes for robustness.
- To assess the impact of this model on banking operations, particularly in terms of marketing efficiency and resource allocation.

## Methodology
I am adopting a quantitative approach, utilizing anonymized banking datasets for this research. Key steps in the methodology include:
- Preprocessing and exploratory analysis of the data.
- Selecting and engineering relevant features for the predictive model.
- Training and comparing various statistical and machine learning models.
- Validating the model with out-of-time data to ensure its effectiveness.
- Interpreting the results within the context of banking industry's requirements for lead scoring.
